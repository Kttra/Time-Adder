# Time Adder

Purpose of the program is to receive multiple time inputs from the user and add up the time.

The expected input will be in the format min:sec.
For example, "12:34" would be considered valid input.

Valid input examples would be:
- 12+34+54
- 12:00 + 13
- 14 + 10:00
- 11:00
- 12:34 + 13:00 + 41:00

Invalid input would be:
- 14 + 10:00 + 10:00
- 10:00 + 14 + 10:00
- 12:30 + 12:30 + 12:30

This program can be improved upon by using a vector or an array to store the inputs and then add them up.
